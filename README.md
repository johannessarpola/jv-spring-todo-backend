# spring-todo-backend

Currently WIP. This is started as learning project for Spring boot but will finish as a small backend service
to perform some learning experiences later. 

Will feature
- Simple authentication against custom user details service on Spring Boot
- Basic authenticated endpoints
- Offer some basic endpoints to save and retrieve todos
- Probably some basic admin UI
